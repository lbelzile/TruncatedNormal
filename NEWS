TruncatedNormal changelog

version 2.1.x
* ptmvnorm and ptmvt now return 1 if all points exceed the upper bounds (incorrectly returned zero/NA in previous versions) (thanks to Adelchi Azzalini)
* Probability estimates now capped at 0/1 in ptmvt/ptmvnorm
* Check for solution to saddlepoint problem now omits zero variable.

version 2.1.2

* ptmvtnorm and ptmvt return 0 for points outside the truncated region instead of NA (thanks to Adelchi Azzalini)
* Fixed a bug in rtmvt that returned incorrect output (tranposed mean vector)


version 2.1

* bug fix: Cholesky decomposition with permutation now checks the arguments to ensure lb less than ub, to avoid segfault errors. In case of degenerate bounds, the conditional distribution is used with fixed components for the degenerate variables (issue #2)
* Moved back probit example in documentation
* change back to randtoolbox package

version 2.0

* Can specify mean vector directly in the functions
* Functions for multivariate Student simulation ported from Matlab
* Change to the interface
* Many functions now internal (documented)
* Cholesky matrix permutation (GGB and GE reordering now supported)
* Selected code rewritten in Rcpp
* New vignette
* Removed random seed
* Change to qrng package for QRN generation of the Sobol s (randtoolbox package unmaintained) - the sequence is not scrambled
* Throw error if NaN in bounds
* Handle univariate cases in mvrandt and mvrandn
* Use nleq solver to solve convex program (also check KKT conditions)

version 1.0

*Initial release
